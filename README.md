# M2BERT_files

Pretrained model and processed data for M2BERT.

I wanted to upload them to zenodo but zenodo is extremely slow so I choose to use git lfs. Seems like it finally works......

**Usage**

- For datasets, unzip zip files, put them to Data/
- No need of any operation for the pretrained model
