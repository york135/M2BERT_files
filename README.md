# M2BERT_files

Pretrained model and processed data for M2BERT.

I wanted to upload them to zenodo but zenodo is extremely slow so I choose to use git lfs. Seems like it does work, but I have to split zip files to 1024MB volumes to avoid the 2GB git lfs limit......

**Usage**

- For datasets, unzip zip files (select ALL \*.z\* files), put them to Data/
- No need for any operation for the pretrained model
